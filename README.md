# Albums

## Setup
To set up the development environment for React Native, follow this guide:
[React Native - Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

I installed XCode, HomeBrew, Node/NPM, watchman, RN CLI.

```
To run your app on iOS:
  cd to project root directory
  react-native run-ios
  - or -
  Open ios/albums.xcodeproj in Xcode
  Hit the Run button
To run your app on Android:
  cd to project root directory
  Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected
  react-native run-android
```
After editing code, hit âŒ˜R in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!
